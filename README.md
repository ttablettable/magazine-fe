## Concept

Each story in Table is treated like a living document — readers can annotate, remix, or fork it.
Every version is stored as a commit, and updated stories are visible as new “editions.”
This repository handles the frontend display, reader interactions, and story versioning UI.

## Plans
- [ ] Integration with GitHub for article version history
- [ ] Annotation overlay + commit visualization
- [ ] Admin dashboard for publishing and revisions
- [ ] Modular story components (articles, essays, interviews, auctions)
